# IMPLEMENTATION OF EULER, RUNGE KUTTA AND MULTI STEP EXE PROGRAM

## The program was written using the python programming language without any external packages and the program was converted from a python file to an exe file using the auto-py-to-exe

## Step 1

### The program will request the user to choose their preferred solution option using A or B or C (not case sensitive)

### A – Euler

### B – Runge Kutta Method

### C – Multi Step Method (Predictor and Corrector Method)

## Step 2

### After selecting your preferred solution option, the program will ask for question values one at a time which you will be required only to input numerical values.

## Step 3

### The user numerical inputs will be computed and an answer will be returned and displayed

## Step 4

### The program will ask the user if they would like to solve another question or not, the user will be able to solve another question by the input of y (not case sensitive) then the program will start from the beginning but if the user inputs another character that is different from y the program will terminate.

## There is a executable file that was generated with the current repo using auto-py-to-exe
